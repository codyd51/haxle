This repository contains a virtual machine implementation along with an assembler capable of producing executables the VM can run.

These tools are intended to be used in [axle's](www.github.com/codyd51/axle.git) hypervisor, a UNIX-like operating system I'm developing. However, as they only require a sane C standard library, they can be used on most platforms. Eat your heart out, Java
